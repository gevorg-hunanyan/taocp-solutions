> Show that the "Procedure for Reading This Set of Books" that appears in the preface actually fails to be a genuine algorithm on three of our five counts! Also mention some differences in format between it and Algorithm $E$.

---

1. Not finite as the procedure never terminates.
2. Not definite, as in step $5$ the term "interesting" is not well-defined.
3. No input, but we allowed zero inputs, so this property is satisfied.
4. There is no output, but one might assume a dummy output in case the procedure terminates.
5. Not necessarily effective as step $18$ might need infinite amount of time.

Therefore it is not finite, not definite, and not effective.
