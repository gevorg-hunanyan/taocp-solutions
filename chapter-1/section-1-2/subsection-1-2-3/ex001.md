> What does the notation $\sum_{1\le j\le n}a_j$ mean, if $n=3.14$?

---

Recall that $\sum_{R(j)}a_j$ means the sum of all $a_j$ where $j$ is an integer satisfying the condition $R(j)$. In this case $R(j)$ is the condition $1\le j\le n$, which is satisfied if $j$ is $1$, $2$, or $3$ (as $n=3.14$).

Therefore $\sum_{1\le j\le n}a_j=a_1+a_2+a_3$.
