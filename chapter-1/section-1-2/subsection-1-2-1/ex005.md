> A prime number is an integer $>1$ that has no exact divisors other than $1$ and itself. Using this definition and mathematical induction, prove that every integer $>1$ may be written as a product of one or more prime numbers.

Assume $2,3,\ldots,n-1$ may be written as a product of one or more prime numbers. Then $n$ is either prime, or $n=km$ with $1<k,m<n$. By the hypothesis $k$ and $m$ are products of primes: $k=k_1k_2\cdots k_\alpha$, $m=m_1m_2\cdots m_\beta$, so $n=k_1k_2\cdots k_\alpha m_1m_2\cdots m_\beta$.
