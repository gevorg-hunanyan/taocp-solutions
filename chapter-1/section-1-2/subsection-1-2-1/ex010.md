> Prove by induction that if $n\ge10$, then $2^n>n^3$.

---

Base Case: If $n=10$, then $2^{10}=1024>1000=10^3$.

Induction Step: Assume $2^n>n^3$.

First note that $2n^3>(n+1)^3$, because

$$
  2n^3-(n+1)^3 = 2n^3-(n^3+3n^2+3n+1) = n^3-3n^2-3n-1 \ge 1000 - 300 - 30 - 1 = 669 > 0.
$$

Then

$$
  2^{n+1} = 2\cdot2^n > 2n^3 > (n+1)^3.
$$

which concludes the proof.
