> (Generalized induction) The text shows how to prove statements $P(n)$ that depend on a single integer $n$, but it does not describe how to prove statements $P(m,n)$ that depend on two integers. In these circumstances a proof is often given by some sort of "double induction", which frequently seems confusing. Actually, there is an important principle more general than simple induction that applies not only to this case but also to situations in which statements are to be proved about uncountable sets - for example, $P(x)$ for all real $x$. This general principle is called *well-ordering*.

> Let $"\prec"$ be a relation on a set $S$, satisfying the following properties:
> <ol type="i">
>   <li> Given $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $S$, if $x\prec y$ and $y\prec z$, then $x\prec z$. </li>
>   <li> Given $x$ and $y$ in $S$, exactly one of the following three possibilities is true: $x\prec y$, $x=y$, or $y\prec x$. </li>
>   <li> If $A$ is any nonempty subset of $S$, there is an element $x$ in $A$ with $x\preceq y$ (that is, $x\prec y$ or $x=y$) for all $y$ in $A$. </li>
> </ol>
> This relation is said to be a well-ordering of $S$. For example, it is clear that the positive integers are well-ordered by the ordinary "less than" relation, $<$.

>   <li> Show that the set of <i>all</i> integers is not well-ordered by $<$. </li>
>   <li> Define a well-ordering relation on the set of all integers. </li>
>   <li> Is the set of all nonnegative real numbers well-ordered by $<$? </li>
>   <li> (<i>Lexicographic order.</i>) Let $S$ be well-ordered by $\prec$, and for $n>0$ let $T_n$ be the set of all $n$-tuples $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of elements $x_j$ in $S$. Define $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\prec(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$, if there is some $k$, $1\le k\le n$, such that $x_j=y_j$ for $1\le j < k$, but $x_k\prec y_k$ in $S$. Is $\prec$ a well-ordering of $T_n$? </li>
>   <li> Continuing part (d), let $T=\bigcup_{n\ge 1}T_n$; define $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m)\prec(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$ if $x_j=y_j$ for $1\le j < k$ and $x_k\prec y_k$ for some $k\le\min(m,n)$, or if $m< n$ and $x_j=y_j$ for $1\le j\le m$. Is $\prec$ a well-ordering of $T$? </li>
>   <li> Show that $\prec$ is a well-ordering of $S$ if and only if it satisfies (i) and (ii) above and there is no infinite sequence $x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots$ with $x_{j+1}\prec x_j$ for all $j\ge 1$. </li>
>   <li> Let $S$ be well-ordered by $\prec$, and let $P(x)$ be a statement about the element $x$ of $S$. Show that if $P(x)$ can be proved under the assumption that $P(y)$ is true for all $y\prec x$, then $P(x)$ is true for <i>all</i> $x$ in $S$. </li>

> [*Notes:* Part (g) is the generalization of simple induction that was promised; in the case $S=$positive integers, it is just the simple case of mathematical induction treated in the text. In that case we are asked to prove that $P(1)$ is true if $P(y)$ is true for all positive integers $y<1$; this is the same as saying we should prove $P(1)$, since $P(y)$ certainly is (vacuously) true for all such $y$. Consequently, one finds that in many situations $P(1)$ need not be proved using a special argument.

> Part (d), in connection with part (g), gives us a powerful method of $n$-tuple induction for proving statements $P(m_1,\ldots,m_n)$ about $n$ positive integers $m_1,\ldots,m_n$.
>
> Part (f) has further application to computer algorithms: If we can map each state $x$ of a computation into an element $f(x)$ belonging to a well-ordered set $S$, in such a way that every step of the computation takes a state $x$ into a state $y$ with $f(y)\prec f(x)$, then the algorithm must terminate. This principle generalizes the argument about strictly decreasing values of $n$, by which we proved the termination of Algorithm 1.1E.]
