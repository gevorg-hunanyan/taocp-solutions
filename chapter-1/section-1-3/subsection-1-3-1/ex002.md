> Which of the letters $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F,a,b,d,c,e,f\\}$ are *odd* when considered as (a) hexadecimal digits? (b) ASCII characters?

---

Since $^\\#a=^\\#A=10,\\;^\\#b=^\\#B=11,\\;\ldots,\\;^\\#f=^\\#F=16$ it follows that $\\{B,D,E,b,d,e\\}$ are the odd ones.

Below are the corresponding ASCII codes in binary, the odd ones are the ones ending with $1$, which are $\\{A,C,E,a,c,e\\}$.
