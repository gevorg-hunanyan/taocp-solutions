> Give an "effective" formal algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of positive integers $m$ and $n$, by specifying $\theta_j$, $\Phi_j$, $a_j$, $b_j$ as in Eqs. (3). Let the input be represented by the string $a^mb^m$, that is, $m$ $a$'s followed by $n$ $b$'s. Try to make your solution as simple as possible. [Hint: Use Algorithm $E$, but instead of division in step $E1$, set r\leftarrow |m-n|, n\leftarrow \min(m,n).]
